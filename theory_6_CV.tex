%\section{Perspective Projection}
%%==========================================================
%
%\textbf{Camera model.} Each 3D point is projected along viewing rays
%onto the image plane. Depending on the chosen camera model, these
%viewing rays are parallel (parallel projection or orthographic
%projection), or they all intersect in a single point, the optical
%center (perspective projection).
%
%For orthographic projection, the image coordinates $(x,y)$ are
%directly determined from the 3D object point $(x_p, y_p, z_p)$
%according to
%
%\begin{equation}\label{eqn: OrthographicProjection}
%\begin{split}
%x=x_p \\
%y=y_p
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%
%Note that the depth of the object point has no influence on the
%resulting image coordinate.  All rays coming from the 3D object are
%assumed to be parallel which is a good approximation for cameras
%with a large focal length corresponding to a small viewing angle.
%Due to the linear mapping of the coordinates in Equation \ref{eqn:
%OrthographicProjection}, the use of this projection model leads to
%simpler algorithms for the estimation of motion parameters from 2D
%images.
%
%The perspective projection uses a non-linear mapping between 3D and
%2D coordinates given by
%
%\begin{equation}\label{eqn: PerspectiveProjection1}
%\begin{split}
%\frac{x}{x_p}= \frac{z}{z_p} \\
%\frac{y}{y_p}= \frac{z}{z_p}
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%
%Here $z_p$ is equal to the distance between the optical center and
%the image plane, and can be replaced with $f$
%
%\begin{equation}\label{eqn: PerspectiveProjection2}
%\begin{split}
%x= f \frac{x_p}{z_p} \\
%y =f \frac{y_p}{z_p}
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%
%
% \textbf{Pinholes.}  The first models of \emph{camera obscura},
%literally dark chamber, invented in the 16th century did not have
%lenses but used a \emph{pinhole} to focus light rays onto a wall or
%translucent plate and demonstrate the laws of perspective discovered
%a century earlier by Brunelleschi (1377  April 15, 1446)
%
%\textbf{Lenses.}  Pinholes were replaced by more sophisticated
%lenses as early as 1550.
%
%\textbf{Imaging surface.}  For normal cameras, it is generally a
%rectangle. For panoramic cameras and the eye, it is spherical.
%
%\textbf{image plane.}
%
%\textbf{Hyperspectral sensors.}
%
%\textbf{Pinhole perspective projection model or Central Perspective
%Projection Model.}  This model creates inverted images.  Two
%byproducts of this model are that far objects appear smaller than
%closer ones.
%
%\textbf{virtual image.} Convenient to consider it in front of the
%pinhole at the same distance from it as the actual image plane.
%
%\textbf{projection.} The \emph{projections} of two parallel lines
%lying in some plane $\Pi$ appear to converge on a horizon line $H$.
%The horizon line is formed by the intersection of the image plane
%with a plane passing through the pinhole and parallel to $Pi$.
%
%Think of this, where the parallel lines meet at a far off distance,
%you have a pinhole.  Well, since there is a pinhole only over there,
%these lines will definitely meet at the pinhole.
%
%I think the reason is as follows:  when you look straight, you are
%looking at a point.
%
%Another way.  Suppose your two eyes could operate separately and
%they were far apart, and you bend down to the level of the lines, so
%that one could look "down" one line with one eye, and look down the
%other line with the other eye.  Now, both lines would always remain
%parallel.
%
%Now you start getting up, you are at the center of both lines, and
%your eyes are normal again, so they look at one point.  At one
%point, light rays from both lines come, and you feel that the lines
%are intersecting.
%
%\textbf{optical axis.} $\bot$ to image plane passing through
%pinhole.
%
%\textbf{image center.} point at which optical axis hits image plane.

%\subsection{non-Euclidean Geometry}
%%==========================================================
%(Forsyth and Ponce, 20)
%Euclid wrote 5 axioms (he called them postulates).  The first 4
%postulates are so self-evident that they clearly ought to be
%satisfied by anything worthy of the name "geometry".  The fifth
%postulate, the parallel postulate says that for any line L and any
%point P not on L, there exists a unique line that is parallel to L
%(never meets L) and passes through P.   For centuries,
%mathematicians tried to prove the 5th postulate using the first 4
%but failed.  Now, it has been realized that this postulate is
%independent of the first 4 and you get a perfectly consistent system
%even if you assume that the parallel postulate is false.  This means
%that it is possible to assign meaning to the terms "point" and
%"line" in such a way that they satisfy the first four postulates but
%not the parallel postulate.  These are called non-Euclidean
%geometries.

%\subsection{Euclidean Geometry }
%%==========================================================
%(Forsyth and Ponce, 20)
%
%%==========================================================
%\subsection{Affine geometry}
%%==========================================================
% (Forsyth and Ponce, 253)
%Affine Geometry is, roughly speaking, what is left after all ability
%to measure lengths, areas and angles has been removed from Euclidean
%geometry.  The concept of parallelism remains, however, as well as
%the ability to measure ratio of distances between collinear points.
%Giving a rigorous axiomatic introduction to affine geometry would be
%out of place here.
%
%
%%==========================================================
%\subsection{Projective geometry}
%%==========================================================
%(Forsyth and Ponce, 253)
%Projective geometry is not really a typical non-Euclidean geometry,
%but it can still be treated as such.
%
%In the axiomatic approach, projective geometry means any collection
%of things called "points"  and things called "lines" that obey the
%first four basic properties that points and lines in a familiar flat
%plane do, but which instead of the parallel postulate, satisfy the
%following opposite property instead:
%
%The projective axiom: Any two lines intersect (in exactly one
%point).
%
%Using only this statement, together with the other basic axioms of
%geometry, one can prove theorems about projective geometry.  Many of
%them are the same as ordinary geometry, the big difference is that
%there is no such thing as a pair of parallel, non-intersecting lines
%in projective geometry.
%
%One interesting fact worth mentioning is that in projective
%geometry, points and lines are completely interchangeable.  That is,
%any statement about points and lines would still be true even if you
%replaced all occurrences of the word "point" with the word "line",
%and vice versa.  For instance, the basic axiom that "for any two
%points, there is a unique line that intersects both these points"
%which turned around becomes, "for any two lines, there is a unique
%point that intersects (ie lies on) both those lines".
%
%Each point of projective geometry is a line passing through the
%origin in 3D space.  So projective geometry can be thought of as the
%collection of all lines through the origin in 3D space.  The
%distance between 2 points can be thought of as the angle between the
%corresponding lines.
%
%A line in projective geometry is really a family of lines through
%the origin in 3D space.
%
%
% The means of measurement available in
%projective geometry are even more primitive than those available in
%affine geometry. The affine notions of ratios of lengths along
%parallel lines and in fact, the notion of parallelism are gone.  The
%concepts of points, lines and plains remain, however, as well as a
%new, weaker scalar measure of the arrangement of collinear points -
%the cross-ratio. As in the affine case, a rigorous axiomatic
%introduction to projective geometry would be out of place here.
%
%Take each line of Euclidean geometry and add to it one extra object,
%called a "point at infinity".  For parallel lines, add the same
%object so that the extended lines intersect.  For non-parallel
%lines, add a different object so that the extended lines do not
%intersect more than once).
%
%The points of projective space are the points in Euclidean geometry
%together with these additional objects.
%
%%==========================================================
%\subsection{Points at infinity}
%%==========================================================
%
%The projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$ can be viewed as the union of
%the usual space $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the set of points at infinity.
%The neat thing about this formalism is that the points at infinity
%are not special and are treated just like any other point.
%
%\textbf{Example.}  In the projective plane, there is one point at
%infinity for each direction in the plane.  $(1,0,0)^T$ is associated
%with the horizontal direction, $(0,1,0)^T$ is associated with the
%vertical direction, and so on.
%
%%==========================================================
%\subsection{Euclidean vs Projective Geometry}
%%==========================================================
%
%Euclidean Geometry is based on the 5 basic postulates of Euclid.
%These postulates are quite basic and say things like, "2 points can
%be joined to create a line", etc.  Here we are interested in the 5th
%postulate which basically states that two parallel lines will never
%intersect.
%
%Projective Geometry, introduced to better understand perspective
%drawing, differs from Euclidean Geometry in this 5th postulate.  In
%this way, it is a form of non-Euclidean Geometry.
%
%\textbf{2D Projective Geometry.}  In 2D projective geometry, 2 lines
%will \emph{always} intersect at a point \footnote{Parallel lines
%will intersect at infinity.}.  The following equation is used to
%represent points and lines:
%
%\begin{equation}
%ax + by + cw = 0
%\end{equation}
%
%In this equation, 3 coordinate points define both a point and a
%line.  This is discussed further in the following lines.
%
%\textbf{Equation of point in 2D projective geometry}. If $(x,y,w)$
%are given, we have an equation for a point.  You can optionally
%divide $(x,y,w)$ by $w$ to get $(x/w,y/w,w/w)$.  Why would you want
%to do this?  Well, if $w=0$, then dividing by 0 shows that the point
%lies at infinity\footnote{This could be the case if you are
%computing the intersection of two parallel lines.}. The point formed
%by the intersection of two lines $(a_1, b_1, c_1)$ and $(a_2, b_2,
%c_2)$, can be computed using
%
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{pmatrix}
%\hat{i} & \hat{j}   &   \hat{k} \\
%a_1     & b_1       &   c_1 \\
%a_2     & b_2       &   c_2
%\end{pmatrix}
%\end{equation}
%
%
%\textbf{Equation of line in 2D projective geometry}. If $(a,b,c)$
%are given, we have an equation for a line.  Also, just substitute
%$w=1$.  If the equation of the line is of the form $(0,0,w)$, then
%the line lies at infinity.  The line formed by the intersection of
%two points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$, can be computed
%using
%
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{pmatrix}
%\hat{i} & \hat{j}   &   \hat{k} \\
%x_1     & y_1       &   z_1 \\
%x_2     & y_2       &   z_2
%\end{pmatrix}
%\end{equation}
%
%
%\textbf{3D Projective Geometry.}  In 3D projective geometry, 3
%planes will \emph{always} intersect at a point \footnote{Parallel
%planes will intersect at infinity.}.  The following equation is used
%to represent points and planes:
%
%\begin{equation}
%ax + by + cz + dw = 0
%\end{equation}
%
%In this equation, 4 coordinate points define both a point and a
%plane. This is discussed further in the following lines.
%
%
%\textbf{Equation of point in 3D projective geometry}. If $(x,y,z,w)$
%are given, we have an equation for a point.  You can optionally
%divide $(x,y,z,w)$ by $w$ to get $(x/w,y/w,z/w,w/w)$.  Why would you
%want to do this?  Well, if $w=0$, then dividing by 0 shows that the
%point lies at infinity\footnote{This could be the case if you are
%computing the intersection of two parallel planes.}. The point
%formed by the intersection of two planes $(a_1, b_1, c_1, d_1)$ and
%$(a_2, b_2, c_2, d_2)$, can be computed using
%
%\begin{equation}
%det
%\begin{pmatrix}
%a       & b         &   c       &       d \\
%a_1     & b_1       &   c_1     &       d_1\\
%a_2     & b_2       &   c_2     &       d_2\\
%a_3     & b_3       &   c_3     &       d_3\\
%\end{pmatrix}
%=0
%\end{equation}
%
%\textbf{Equation of plane in 3D projective geometry}. If $(a,b,c,d)$
%are given, we have an equation for a plane.  Also, just substitute
%$w=1$.  The plane formed by the intersection of three points $(x_1,
%y_1, z_1, w_1)$, $(x_2, y_2, z_2, w_2)$ and $(x_3, y_3, z_3, w_3)$
%can be computed using
%
%\begin{equation}
%det
%\begin{pmatrix}
%x       & y         &   z       &       w \\
%x_1     & y_1       &   z_1     &       w_1\\
%x_2     & y_2       &   z_2     &       w_2\\
%x_3     & y_3       &   z_3     &       w_3\\
%\end{pmatrix}
%=0
%\end{equation}
%%==========================================================
%\subsection{Why Projective Geometry}
%%==========================================================
%
%Although the natural geometry which we use in most applications is
%Euclidean geometry, it is simpler and more efficient for vision to
%consider the Euclidean and affine geometries as special cases of the
%projective geometry.  It is simpler because the projective geometry
%is the geometry of image formation and provides a unified framework
%for thinking about all geometric problems that are relevant to
%vision.
%
%%==========================================================
%\subsection{Epipolar geometry and Trifocal}
%%==========================================================
%Epipolar (2 view)
%Trifocal (3 view)
%\textbf{2 view geometry.}  Epipolar geometry is used in all projects
%dealing with binocular stereo.  It is a projective concept and it
%can be described geometrically and algebraically quite simply and
%efficiently in that framework.  No notions of affine or Euclidean
%geometry are necessary.  From the algebraic viewpoint, a single 3x3
%matrix, called the \emph{Fundamental Matrix} summarizes everything
%you need to know about the epipolar geometry.
%
%Keeping in mind that some applications require more knowledge than
%just projective, we also analyze how affine and Euclidean
%information is buried into the Fundamental Matrix.
%
%\textbf{3 view geometry}  The equivalent of the Fundamental Matrix
%here is the \emph{Trifocal Tensor.}  The trifocal tensors are, like
%the Fundamental Matrices, purely projective entities but also
%contain affine and Euclidean information.
%
%
%%==========================================================
%\subsection{General}
%%==========================================================
%
%\textbf{Projective invariant properties.}  Intersections of planes
%and lines.
%
%\textbf{Projective invariant quantities.}  Cross-ratios.
%
%\textbf{Affine invariant properties.}  Parallelism or certain ratios
%of lengths.
%
%\textbf{Going from affine to projective.}

%\section{Pattern Theory}
%%####################################################################################################
%
%Pattern Theory is a popular basis for image interpretation in the
%statistical community.  It puts the treatment of prior knowledge
%about shape into a probabilistic context by regarding any shape as
%the result of applying some distortion to an ideal prototype shape.
%The nature and extent of the distortion is governed by an
%appropriate probability distribution which then effectively defines
%the range of likely shapes.
%
%Defining a prior distribution for shape is only part of the problem.
%The complete image interpretation task is to modify the prior
%distribution to take account of image features, arriving at a
%\emph{posterior} distribution for what shape is actually likely to
%be present in a particular image.  Mechanisms for fusing a prior
%distribution with \emph{observations} are of crucial importance.
%Suffice it to say here that a key idea of pattern theory is
%"recognition by synthesis," in which prediction of likely shapes,
%based on the prior distribution, are tested against a particular
%image.  Any discrepancy between what is predicted and what is
%actually observed can be used as an error signal, to correct the
%estimated shape.
%
%Fusion mechanisms of this general type exist in the snake
%\footnote{Notice that snakes are present here as well.}, in the
%ubiquitous Kalman Filter, and in more general forms discussed later.
